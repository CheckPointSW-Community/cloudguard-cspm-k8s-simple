#cloudguardk8s
----------------

This is a really simple scirpt which automates onboarding your Kubernetes cluster to CloudGuard CSPM (Dome9). I've created both Python and Bashshell scripts that basically do the same thing. Either script requires that you already have access to a CloudGuard CSPM account, have installed kubectl and obtained CloudGuard API Key and Secret. Of course Python verstion of the script requires that you've installed Python 3.x. You just need to run either one.

#Python
Just run the script, and it'll ask for necessary information (e.g. cluster name) to onboard the cluster to CloudGuard

For example. "python ./onboardk8s.py"

#Bash shell

Just run the shell script, and it'll ask for necessary information (e.g. cluster name to onboard the cluster to CloudGuard.

For example, "./onboardk8s_sh.sh"


$ ./onboardk8s_sh.sh 
Enter Your Cluster Name: cloudguarder1
Enter Namespace: checkpoint
Enter CloudGuard API Key: [YOUR CLOUDGUARD API KEY]
Enter CloudGuard API Secret: [YOUR CLOUDGUARD API SECRET]
your CloudGuard cluster ID is [YOUR CLOUDGUARD ID]
Hello, CloudGuarder! We are onboarding cloudguarder1 to CloudGuard. Give us a moment.
